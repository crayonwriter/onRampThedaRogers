# Onramp Android Take Home Project 

This project was to be my submission for the Onramp Android Take Home Project. The project's topic was to be resources for people with low to no income.

The plan was to have a grid layout with several buttons, each with a different topic (doctors, dentists, veterinarians, food banks, etc.). Each button would then open a fragment with a list of local resources for each topic.

I was going to include a service that downloaded articles (when it was listed as a resource) in the background.

Unfortunately, I first started with the new RecyclerView and GridLayoutManager instead of using what I was more familiar with. Thus began a deep learning curve into new classes and methods.

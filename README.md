# Onramp Android Take Home Project 

## Overview ðŸ¤–

Congratulations for making it this far in the interview process for the Pandora Demo Tape Apprenticeship at Onramp. This project seeks to better inform the Onramp team of your experience with Java programming and Android development as well as prepare you for your interview at Pandora. 

You will have seven days to complete it. We expect those who have a moderate level of Android and Java development experience to spend between 24 and 32 hours to design, implement, document, and submit the project to us. Depending on your level, it may take more or less time, so please plan accordingly.

## Description and Details ðŸ”Ž

#### Researching and Plagiarism

You are actively encouraged to research the web, books, videos, or tutorials for this project. That said, we expect all code that is submitted to be your own (e.g. this project should **NOT** be completed with another person). That means that we expect each candidate to refrain from copying and/or pasting code into the project. If we find copied code in your project, we will have to disqualify you.. 

#### Android App Requirements

The Onramp team wants you to build an Android application which is related to something you are passionate about. This will enable us and the Pandora interviewers to learn more about you. Please scope your features to what you can reasonably accomplish within the designated timeframe. Scoping the functionality accurately is important to ensure you have a completed application by the submission deadline. Though the type of application you build and it's feature-set is defined by you, there are architectural requirements which each Android application should meet. They include:

*   The usage of a minimum of at least three [Activities](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities). 
*   The usage of a minimum of at-least one [Service](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/services).
*   The usage of the [MVVM](https://medium.com/@husayn.hakeem/android-by-example-mvvm-data-binding-introduction-part-1-6a7a5f388bf7) architectural pattern.
*   The usage of a minimum of at least five UI components from the [Android Material Design Component Library](https://material.io/design/components/bottom-navigation.html).
*   The usage of a minimum one [Fragment](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments).

**Note you will need to detail where and how your Android App meets these requirements in your repository's  README file when you submit your project.**

## What we're looking for ðŸŒŸ

We will evaluate your project by assessing the overall strength and quality of the following five factors: 

#### UI Design

Android users expect your application to look and behave in a way that's consistently intuitive. Your Android application should utilize thoughtful [animations](https://material.io/design/motion/), [patterns](https://material.io/design/), [style](https://material.io/design/color/), [components](https://material.io/design/components/) and [layouts](https://material.io/design/layout/understanding-layout.html) to create a highly usable user interface.

#### Architecture Pattern

An architecture pattern enables you to define a guide for how a piece of software should function, such that it can be scalable, maintainable, and testable. Common patterns for Android applications include [MVC](https://medium.com/upday-devs/android-architecture-patterns-part-1-model-view-controller-3baecef5f2b6) (Model View Controller), [MVP](https://android.jlelse.eu/architectural-guidelines-to-follow-for-mvp-pattern-in-android-2374848a0157) (Model View Presenter) and [MVVM](https://medium.com/@husayn.hakeem/android-by-example-mvvm-data-binding-introduction-part-1-6a7a5f388bf7) (Model View ViewModel). **Note that it is required that you leverage the MVVM pattern within your Android app.**


#### Core Android Components

[Activities](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities), [Services](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/services), [Broadcast Receivers](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver.html), and [Content Providers](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-providers.html) are four types of Android Application components, which are the essential building blocks of an Android app. Each serves a distinct purpose and has a distinct lifecycle that defines how the component is created and destroyed. 

The usage of Activities and Services are extremely common when implementing Android apps and are therefore **mandatory** to include in your project, however, the usage of a Broadcast Receiver and/or Content Provider is optional, depending on the app design.

#### Android Development Best Practices

It's important to subscribe to a set of best practices when designing and implementing an Android app. Be mindful of these widely accepted principles:

*   [DRY](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/3-key-software-principles-you-must-understand--net-25161) (don't repeat yourself)
*   Maintain a [separation of concerns](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide#separation-of-concerns) within your Android components
*   Specify good [project structure](https://developer.android.com/studio/intro)

Using these principles will result in a high quality user experience while efficiently utilizing phone hardware resources and ensuring other developers can easily navigate through your code.

#### Android Application Description

As detailed above, each project submission must include a README file, which provides an overview of the Android application and details the app's overall MVVM architecture as well as your design decisions.. Screenshots of the Android app taken from the Android Studio emulator are also required. This task assesses the critical competency of communicating and documenting technical concepts.

**Note: Testing frameworks and strategies are intentionally NOT included within the rubric because we want you to dedicate your time to building a functional application (We do realize that UI and Android component testing are critical practices of Android Development, but this take home project prioritizes a focus on surfacing Java/Android development proficiency).**

## Submission Information ðŸš€

#### Submission Format

This repository will be your starting point. Please download (not clone or fork) this Github repository ([onramp-android-take-home](https://github.com/onramp-io/onramp-android-take-home)) and upload changes to a newly created repository. Once the Android application has been completed, you'll be submitting a link to the new repository you created. Prior to submitting your project, you should update the README file to provide the following information:

*   A high level architectural overview of your Android application. e.g. names, relationships and purposes of all components, including Activities, Services, Content Providers, Broadcast Receivers, etc. 
*   A brief description of any design patterns that you leveraged.
*   [Screenshots](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/am-screenshot) of each Activity View and descriptions of the overall user flow.

#### Submission Deadline + Process

You must submit your project at **11:59pm PST, the night before your interview**. Your project will be considered complete when you email [submissions@onramp.io](mailto:engineering@onramp.io) with a link to your repository.
